# Terraform Sample Codes

Welcome to the "Terraform Sample Codes" repository! This repository contains a collection of Terraform code snippets and examples that I've written during my practice sessions with Terraform. 😊

## Introduction

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON. 💻

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for individuals learning Terraform or looking for examples of how to use Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure. Each code snippet or example is accompanied by a brief description explaining its purpose and usage. 📚

## Contents

The repository is organized into directories based on different use cases, cloud providers, or types of infrastructure. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

- `aws-examples/`: Examples of Terraform code for provisioning resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS). ☁️
- `azure-examples/`: Examples of Terraform code for provisioning resources on Microsoft Azure. 🌐
- `gcp-examples/`: Examples of Terraform code for provisioning resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 🚀
- `common-examples/`: General-purpose Terraform examples that may apply across multiple cloud providers or scenarios. 🛠️

Feel free to explore the directories and code snippets to learn more about how Terraform works and how it can be used to automate infrastructure provisioning. 🕵️‍♂️
